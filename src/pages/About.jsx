        <h2>Hello there!</h2>
        <p>
          I used to be a sales representative but that's a fancy term. In my
          country, Nigeria, it is called sales boy. I worked in this position
          for about 3 years while waiting for a dream job.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dream job refers to a white/blue-collar job in my locality. And
          although I had heard and loved programming earlier, I never knew how
          to become one.

          Then came Andela 4.0 in 2019. This was a programme by google, Andela
          and Pluralsight, a fourth in its series and an entry for me into the
          tech space.

          During the pandemic, I quit my job and began a full-time journey with
          the help of family and mentors. I took courses from freeCodeCamp,
          Coursera, Udacity and Udemy and as well YouTube.

          Soon I learned about Microverse and the beautiful opportunity it
          offered programmers. I joined microverse in January 2021 and as the
          saying goes, the rest is history…

          Today, I have learned some of the best technologies in the industry. I
          build and learn at the same time. This is why you should consider me
          to be a part of your team or build your solution.
        </p>
        <p>Let's build better solutions and a better world.</p>
