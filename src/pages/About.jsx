        <h2>Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹</h2>
        <p>
          I used to be a sales representative ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž but that's a fancy term. In
          my country, Nigeria, it is called a sales boy. I worked in this
          position for about 3 years while waiting for a dream job.

          A dream job refers to a white/blue-collar job in my locality. And
          although I had heard and loved programming earlier, I never knew how
          to become one. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

          Then came Andela 4.0 in 2019. This was a programme by google, Andela
          and Pluralsight, a fourth in its series and an entry for me into the
          tech space.

          During the pandemic, I quit my job and began a full-time journey with
          the help of family and mentors. I took courses from freeCodeCamp,
          Coursera, Udacity and Udemy and as well YouTube.

          Soon I learned about{' '}
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microverse.org/?grsf=rxykm0">
            Microverse
          </a>{' '}
          and the beautiful opportunity it offered programmers. I joined
          microverse in January 2021 and as the saying goes, the rest is
          historyâ€¦

          Today, I have learned some of the best technologies in the industry. I
          build and learn at the same time. This is why you should consider me
          to be a part of your team or build your solution.

        <p>Let's build better solutions and a better world.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          When I am not writing computer codes, I am seeing movies, travelling,
          singing in my band or writing an article. Feel free to drop by my
          articles page to see if some of my posts might interest you.
        </p>
        <p>I also love to bake or â€˜organiseâ€™ sumptuous meals.</p>
