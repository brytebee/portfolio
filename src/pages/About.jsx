    <h2>Hello there!</h2>
    <p>
      I used to be a sales representative but that's a fancy term. In my
      country, Nigeria, it is called sales boy. I worked in this position for
      about 3 years while waiting for a dream job.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dream job refers to a white/blue-collar job in my locality. And although
      I had heard and loved programming earlier, I never knew how to become one.
