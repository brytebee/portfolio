        <h2>Hello there! 👋👋</h2>
        <p>
          I used to be a sales representative 😎😎 but that's a fancy term. In
          my country, Nigeria, it is called a sales boy. I worked in this
          position for about 3 years while waiting for a dream job.

          A dream job refers to a white/blue-collar job in my locality. And
          although I had heard and loved programming earlier, I never knew how
          to become one. 😭😭

          Then came Andela 4.0 in 2019. This was a programme by google, Andela
          and Pluralsight, a fourth in its series and an entry for me into the
          tech space.

          During the pandemic, I quit my job and began a full-time journey with
          the help of family and mentors. I took courses from freeCodeCamp,
          Coursera, Udacity and Udemy and as well YouTube.

          Soon I learned about{' '}
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microverse.org/?grsf=rxykm0">
            Microverse
          </a>{' '}
          and the beautiful opportunity it offered programmers. I joined
          microverse in January 2021 and as the saying goes, the rest is
          history…
