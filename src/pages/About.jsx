    <h2>Hello there!</h2>

      I used to be a sales representative but that's a fancy term. In my
      country, Nigeria, it is called sales boy. I worked in this position for
      about 3 years while waiting for a dream job.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dream job refers to a white/blue-collar job in my locality. And although
      I had heard and loved programming earlier, I never knew how to become one.

      Then came Andela 4.0 in 2019. This was a programme by google, Andela and
      Pluralsight, a fourth in its series and an entry for me into the tech
      space.

      During the pandemic, I quit my job and began a full-time journey with the
      help of family and mentors. I took courses from freeCodeCamp, Coursera,
      Udacity and Udemy and as well YouTube.

      Soon I learned about Microverse and the beautiful opportunity it offered
      programmers. I joined microverse in January 2021 and as the saying goes,
      the rest is historyâ€¦
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I have learned some of the best technologies in the industry. I
      build and learn at the same time. This is why you should consider me to be
      a part of your team or build your solution.
    </p>
    <p>Let's build better solutions and a better world.</p>
